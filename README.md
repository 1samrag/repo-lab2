# repo-lab2
the topic I choose to focus on was the time around the covid pandemic. BLM escalated during the dormant time of the world during the corona virus outbreak, so the words I chose are pertinent to the time. In addition to searching for the phrase BLM I searched for "corona virus" which set the theme for the time period, and "remote" becuase the corona virus paved the way for remote viewing, working remotely, and remote sensing in many aspects of the world. I thought it was interesting to make a comparison of the frequency of the words I choose with one another becuase the words overlap in the real world.
