The topic I choose to focus on was the time around the covid pandemic. BLM escalated during the dormant time of the world during the corona virus outbreak, so the words I chose are pertinent to the time. In addition to searching for the phrase BLM I searched for "corona virus" which matched the theme for the time period, and "remote" becuase the corona virus paved the way for remote viewing, working remotely, and remote sensing in many aspects of the world. I thought it was interesting to make a comparison of the frequency of the words I choose with one another becuase the words overlap in the real world so it would be cool to observe trends that lie within. The three word clouds are very different, in the BLM word map and the remote word map they both fequently associate with the word "people." Other than that there are very little similar words across the three maps. The three maps offer a chronological order of the time, the corona virus map captures the essence of the begining staged of the virus outbreak. Words like "virus" and "bat" "found" and "lockdown" are all the preliminary actions the globe took when speaking about topics on the subject of the corona virus. Secondly, in the word map for BLM words like "riot,"  "police," and "protest" are common, this depicts the middle stages of how the world coped with the change that the corona virus sparked to the daily life. Lastly, the word map of the word "remote" involved words like "need", "job" "work", "look", "new", and "want". This word map captures the ending stages to the corona pandemic in offering a new and nuanced approach to living life with corona instead of fighting or ignoring it. The patterns I noticed in the word map revealing the different stages the world grow out of and into becuase of the corona virus exist highlights the idea that "everything will be okay in the end and if its not, it is not the end." The small steps of adjusting to change or something new are vital no matter how uncomfortable to seeing something great at the end. The events of the corona virus reminded the world of the virtues of adapdability of resilliance. The search can be improved in the future by implementing software that gives a greater look into the context into how the word where being used. For example displaying top use of the word in context by highlighting tweets that maybe had the most engagment along with the word. This can allow for greater analysis and conclusions to be drawn from the data.

Some things from the map that initlly surprised me was the lack or overlapping words, but I now understand the time period each word became relevant in to understand there relevance in the world. Some aspects that stood out to me was that this word map exposed social medias contravsial beliefs becuase words that showed up in large text from 2 of 3 of the maps were contravsial. Conversation about the corona virus being sourced from Bats showed up with the word "bat," similarly in the BLM word map, we have words like "Antifa" and "democrat." This highlights the sensitivity of online social platforms.
